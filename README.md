# CG2271 Projects by TomLBZ
A Full-stack solution for CG2271 Project.

Note: By TomLBZ. Purposefully left non-completed for some parts. Do not copy.

## Projects Included

- Embedded System: RTOS-RTX based multitasker on MDK529 and MDK534. (C)
- Embedded APIs: Useful GPIO libraries and constructs such as DigitalRead, AnalogWrite, etc. (C)
- Mobile Application: Robot controller on Android using Xamarin. (C#)
- Visual GDB: For those who are comfortable using VisualGDB, there is a project template for it. (C++)
- FPGA Peripherals: FPGA based midi music synthesizer (very basic version) and FPGA based DAC. (Verilog)

## Hardware Requirements

- Embedded System: FRDM-KL25Z development board (default target), or better ones (write your own definitions).
- Embedded APIs: General.
- Mobile Application: Android devices running Android X (default target), or above.
- Visual GDB: General.
- FPGA Peripherals: Sipeed Tang Primer FPGA (default target), or better ones (write your own constraint files).
